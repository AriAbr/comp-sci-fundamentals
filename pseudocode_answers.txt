# Exercises

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to help brainstorm and outline before writing real code.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing would happen or you would get an error since pseudocode is not a real computer language.

# Programming Assignment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number THEN
	PRINT first number
ELSE
	PRINT second number
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FOR each number from 1 to 100
	PRINT the number
END FOR

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT name
FOR each entry in the phonebook
	IF the inputted name is equal to the name in the entry THEN
		RETURN the entry
	END IF
END FOR

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer
language of your choice.

function phonebookSearch (name) {
	for (let i=0; i<phonebook.length; i++) {
		var currEntry = phonebook[i];
		if (currEntry.name === name) {
			return currEntry;
		}
	}
}
